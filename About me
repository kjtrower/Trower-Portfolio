<h1> Who am I? <h1>		
		<p> I am a 42 year old new student of Grand Circus of Detroit! I have been married to my husband Derek for 15 years. 
We have 3 children together, 2 girls and one boy. I am about to become an empty nester, our youngest (boy) is 16 and is halfway through his junior in high school. The 2nd oldest is a 19 (almost 20) old girl, going to college in Manhattan. The oldest girl is a 23-year-old grad student at Western. I am currently employed full time working 8-5 Monday thru Friday then next few weeks are going to be a very busy but exciting time! </p>
		 
<h2> My past employment <h2>

		<p> I have been a purchasing manager for the past 20 years and am looking for a change in careers. I am going to be helping in our familyâ€™s software business with apps and the web management. My current job is stressful and there is rarely to take a breath. Aside from the changes going on in the house with my family, going to Grand Circus will make the biggest difference in my life, after I graduate I will be able to work from home instead of in a office. I am very excited for the future! </P>

<h3> Where am I from?  <h3>
		<p>I was born in Pontiac, MI and immediately went to and grew up on a carnival. Thats right! I was a Carnie for 11 years. I then moved in with my grandparents in Oxford, MI. This is also where I went to and graduated from High school> I remained in Oxford until I moved to Grand Blanc, MI. 12 years ago. </p>
